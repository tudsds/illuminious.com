# Text Contrast Issues Found

## Home Page (Screenshot Analysis)
1. **Hero Section**: The text looks OK now with the dark overlay, but "Global Delivery" gradient text could be more visible
2. **Header**: On Home page, header text is white which is correct for dark background

## Issues to Check on Other Pages:
1. **About Page - Global Presence Section**: Need to verify text contrast on dark blue background
2. **Services Page**: Check hero text contrast
3. **News/Blog Pages**: Verify title colors are #132843 as requested
4. **Contact Page**: "Let's Talk" should be black

## Key Fixes Needed:
1. Ensure non-Home/Startups pages have black header text (except active page)
2. Page titles should be #132843 (illuminious-navy)
3. Contact page "Let's Talk" should be black
4. Check all dark background sections for light text
5. Check all light background sections for dark text
