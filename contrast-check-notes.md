# Contrast Check Notes

## Home Page Analysis
- Hero section: Text is now readable with proper shadow and overlay
- "Global Delivery" gradient text is visible but could be brighter
- Navigation text is white on dark background - OK
- Admin portal icon is visible

## Issues to Fix:
1. Home page - "Global Delivery" gradient text could use more contrast
2. Need to check Global Presence section (dark background)
3. Need to check all service pages
4. Need to check About page sections
5. Need to check News/Blog pages
6. Need to check Startups page

## Pages to Review:
- [x] Home (Hero section)
- [ ] Home (Global Presence section)
- [ ] About
- [ ] Services
- [ ] News
- [ ] Blog
- [ ] Contact
- [ ] Startups
