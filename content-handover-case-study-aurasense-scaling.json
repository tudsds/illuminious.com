  "industry": "Consumer Electronics / AI Wearables",
  "challenge": "AuraSense AI needed to reduce unit costs from $140 to under $100 while scaling from prototype to 50,000 units for a global launch. Their sensor complexity required ISO-certified quality that smaller prototype shops couldn't guarantee.",
  "solution": "We utilized our 'U.S. Plus Two' model, performing rapid NPI in Shenzhen for speed and transitioning mass production to Batam for cost optimization and tariff advantages.",

Local US-based prototyping was costing them $140 per unit, far exceeding their target retail price point. To survive their Series A launch, they needed to scale to 50,000 units in under 4 months while maintaining medical-grade quality standards.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlight-box\">\n  <h4>💡 The Solution</h4>\n  <p>Illuminious deployed our <strong>China Plus Two Strategy</strong> to provide both speed and scale. Key elements included:</p>\n  <ul class=\"check-list\">\n    <li><strong>Rapid NPI (Shenzhen):</strong> Completed 3 design iterations and DFM optimization in just 14 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Scale Production (Batam):</strong> Transitioned mass production to our Indonesia hub to leverage lower costs and 0% US tariffs.</li>\n    <li><strong>Custom Test Jigs:</strong> Engineered automated optical and electrical test stations to validate sensitive biometric sensors at scale.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2>📊 Measurable Results</h2>\n\n<div class=\"results-grid\">\n  <div class=\"result-card\">\n    <div class=\"result-value\">$91</div>\n    <div class=\"result-label\">Target Unit Cost</div>\n    <p>A 35% reduction from initial prototype costs through optimized sourcing and Batam manufacturing.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"result-card\">\n    <div class=\"result-value\">14</div>\n    <div class=\"result-label\">Weeks to Launch</div>\n    <p>Accelerated the production timeline by 50% compared to traditional Tier-1 contract manufacturers.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"result-card\">\n    <div class=\"result-value\">99.7%</div>\n    <div class=\"result-label\">First-Pass Yield</div>\n    <p>Consistent, high-quality output using automated testing protocols in our ISO 13485-certified lines.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<h2>🔍 How We Did It</h2>\n\n<div class=\"process-steps\">\n  <div class=\"step\">\n    <h4>1. DFM & Component Optimization (Week 1-2)</h4>\n    <p>Our Shenzhen engineering team identified 4 component alternatives that reduced BOM cost by 18% without affecting sensor accuracy. <strong>Achieved DFM-ready status in 10 days.</strong></p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\">\n    <h4>2. Tooling & Batch Testing (Week 3-6)</h4>\n    <p>Tooling was manufactured in Shenzhen and shipped to Batam. We ran a 500-unit pilot batch to validate the automated testing jigs and assembly SOPs.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\">\n    <h4>3. Mass Production Ramp (Week 7-14)</h4>\n    <p>Production scaled from 5,000 units per week to 15,000 units per week. Our Batam team managed 24/7 shifts to meet the critical launch date.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"testimonial-box\">\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>\"Illuminious solved our biggest nightmare: how to go from a high-cost prototype to a profitable, high-volume product.
